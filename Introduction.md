### 2. Same Origin Policy

  Security mechanism implemented in browsers.
  One site allowed to read/modify data received from same site but not allowed to read content from another site.
  Exceptions:
    1.	Load scripts from other sites using <script> tag.
    2.	Submit form for one site to another but cannot read data.


### 3. Introduction to API

  What is API? </br>
  -> An setting between Client-App and Server-App to exchange data/message.

  Where are API used? </br>
  -> Its used everywhere. E.g. Facebook uses API to fetch data and show on page.

  Why API is used?</br>
  -> 1. API separate backend logic and frontend logic. E.g. We can keep changing fronend of a App and still keep using same API to access backend API.
     2. Reuse code. E.g Get users data via API endpoint.
     3. Easy to fix bug. E.g. fix a bug in vulnerable function without changing frontend of App.
     4. Expand services to third-party developers.
