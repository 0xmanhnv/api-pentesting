1. Check if the given api endpoint is cookie based endpoint.
2. Check if 
****origin**** and ****referrer**** 
header are not validated by server by deleting and resending the request.
> Origin: http://fl4tswa8w0y12jpm-apillab1.labs.peritustrainingschool.com

3. If server is not validating... :smiley: 
4. **Exploit it.**
