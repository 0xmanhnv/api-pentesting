# Various methods to find API Endpoints.

<pre>1. Running web-app through proxy.</pre>
<pre>2. Scanning for js files.</pre>
<pre>3. Using different http methods (get, post, delete, put).</pre>
<pre>4. Developer Docs.</pre>
<pre>5. Application.wadl</pre>
<pre>6. Options and HREF (in response search for href).</pre>
<pre>7. Way Back Machine.</pre>

 ### 1. Running Through proxy
 <pre><b>Note: Browse web app to get more api endpoints.</b></pre>
<pre> 1. Simple method is to check <b>Network</b> Tab in developer tools and filter XHR request.
 2. In burp proxy, select history and check for requests whose response is in either <b>XML</b> or <b>JSON</b> in MIME type.

 Note all endpoints in excel sheet.</br>
 E.g. 
 

| Resource     | Method  | Endpoint                         | Params                   | Other Notes                     |
|--------------|---------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| /reset       | GET     | https://api.bank.xyz/reset       | ?id=1253&pass=*****      | Token not used                  |
|              |         | Keep it blank.                   | We might find additional | endpoints                       |
| /login       | POST    | https://api.bank.xyz/login       | username=Test&Pass=***** | No CSRF Token                   |
|              |         | Keep it blank.                   | We might find additional | endpoints                       |
|              |         | Keep it blank.                   | We might find additional | endpoints                       |
|              |         | Keep it blank.                   | We might find additional | endpoints                       |
| /user        | POST    | https://api.bank.xyz/user        | id=1253                  | Returns token in response       |
| /user/credit | PUT     | https://api.bank.xyz/user/credit | id=1253&credit=100000    | credits 10000                   |
|              |         | Keep it blank.                   | We might find additional | endpoints                       |
|              |         | Keep it blank.                   | We might find additional | endpoints                       |
 
 ### 2. Scanning js files
 <pre>Find additional endpoints which got missed during scanning through proxy and add it to excel sheet.
 JS files might have hidden endpoints which are not accessible to current role.</pre>
 
 <pre>Methodology:
 1. Find all js files using burp.
 2. Find keywords which are addressable resources, found while running through proxy.
 3. Another method to find api in js files is to get js files,
    then use js beautifier and search for HTTP methods in that files.
    E.g. <b>GET</b> or <b>POST</b>.
 4. Also search for <b>$http.</b> or <b>XMLHttpRequest</b> in js files. 
    The XMLHttpRequest is just additonal task, but might give addtional end points.</pre>
