### 1. HTTP Response codes and its meaning


| HTTP Codes              | Meaning                        |
| ----------------------- |:------------------------------:|
| 1xx  Inforamtion        | Protocol informatinal message  |
| 2xx  Success            | Request was successfull        |
| 3xx  Redirection        | Redirection                    |
| 4xx  Client-Side Error  | Error at Client-side           |
| 5xx  Server-Side Error  | Error at Server-side           |

### 2. Same Origin Policy

    Security mechanism implemented in browsers.
    One site allowed to read/modify data received from same site but not allowed to read content from another site.
    Exceptions:
    1.	Load scripts from other sites using <script> tag.
    2.	Submit form for one site to another but cannot read data.


### 3. Introduction to API

    What is API? 
    -> An setting between Client-App and Server-App to exchange data/message.

    Where are API used? 
    -> Its used everywhere. E.g. Facebook uses API to fetch data and show on page.

    Why API is used?
    -> 1. API separate backend logic and frontend logic. E.g. We can keep changing fronend of a App and still keep using same API to access backend API.
     2. Reuse code. E.g Get users data via API endpoint.
     3. Easy to fix bug. E.g. fix a bug in vulnerable function without changing frontend of App.
     4. Expand services to third-party developers.

### 4. API Testing TECHNIQUE
    Find target URI of the API
    Find out how the API authenticates (Cookie Vs Token)
    Find how resources are modeled.
    
### 5. API Authentication methods (Cookie vs Token). 

    1. Cookie Based.
        In this cookie has required information for authentication.
    
    2. Token Based.
        In this, authentication variable other than cookie is used to identify.
        E.g. Basic Auth, JWT, Access Token, etc..
